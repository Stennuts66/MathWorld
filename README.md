Welcome, 2 Math World! This is one of my hobbies of learning Java and Math in two. =)
I'm implementing these exercises https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/math/

This is the console output:

Java program to convert degree to radian. The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, 'used in many areas of mathematics.
An angle's measurement in radians is numerically equal to the length of a corresponding arc of a unit circle.

To convert: 15.0 degrees | Converted to: 0.26180 radians.
